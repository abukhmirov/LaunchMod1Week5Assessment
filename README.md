# Mod 1 Week 5 Assessment

## Questions (10 Points Possible)
1. What would happen if you try to use a variable that is not in scope?

You will get an error saying that the variable is inaccesible outside its scope.

2. Describe the three As of a test:  
A -Arrange the data of the program to make it easier to test   
A -Act on the data with the methods that are in the program
A -Assert that the result of acting on that data with that method is what we expected

3. What is the difference between `public` and `private` access modifiers?

A public modifier lets the code be accessed outside of its class, while a private modifier does the opposite and makes the code only accesible in the class it is in.

4. A method should:  (**Select all that apply**) <br/>
***(A) Make changes to an object***  
***(B) Return some information about an object***  
(C) Make changes to an object and return information about the object.  
(D) None of the Above. 


5. How did you determine what to answer for the question above?

A method can both make changes to an object and return information about it (methods called command and query respectively), but they don't have to do it both at the same time, so D does not apply.

## Exercise (10 Points Possible)

Clone your forked copy of this repository into Visual Studio.  

In this solution, there is a User project with a single User class.  The class works, but it needs some additional effort to be great! One thing that is missing is tests; your job is to write the tests that will confirm the functionality of the class. Write one test for the constructor, and at least one test for each of the other 4 methods. As you write the tests, you might find some refactoring opportunities; update the user class with any refactors you deem necessary and add a comment describing why you made that refactor.  The only rule is that all the existing methods must still exist when you are finished!


## Submission

When finished:
* Commit your changes in Visual Studio
* Push up to GitHub
* DM a link to your forked repository to your instructors
